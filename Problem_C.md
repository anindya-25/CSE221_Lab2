# C. Longest Subarray Sum

**time limit per test:** 1 second  
**memory limit per test:** 256 megabytes  

You are given an array of **N** integers and an integer **K**. Your task is to find the length of the **longest contiguous subarray** whose sum is **less than or equal to K**.

## Input
- The first line contains two integers **N** (1 ≤ N ≤ 10⁵) and **K** (1 ≤ K ≤ 10⁹) — the size of the array and the maximum allowed sum.  
- The second line contains **N** space-separated integers **a₁, a₂, a₃, ..., aₙ** (1 ≤ aᵢ ≤ 10⁶) — the elements of the array.

## Output
Print a single integer — the length of the **longest contiguous subarray** whose sum is **less than or equal to K**.
